[Github action](https://github.com/features/actions) is a powerful tool to automate the deployment of your code.
It is very simple to use, however, in some case, you need to connect to exernal services
to fully handle a build task.

This is the case of a Build and Deployment pipeline using nextjs with a real database.
In this case, connection to database is required to complete the build phase, and it is a little bit tricky
to handle if your database is on a remote server not accessible directly to internet.

Luckily, kubernetes provides a way to port forward a kubernetes port. And GitHub Actions provide a way,
called [container services](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-containerized-services/about-service-containers), to
easly deploy external services that runs parallel to the main action.

Services main porpouse is to provide a simple and portable way for you to host services that you might need to test or operate your application in a workflow.
But we can use it to run a port forward to a database server remotelly on kubernetes.

This post has been mainly inspired from
[How we connect to Kubernetes Pods from GitHub Actions](https://dev.to/richicoder1/how-we-connect-to-kubernetes-pods-from-github-actions-1mg):
the instruction to create a custom service account with the only permission of
enabling port forwarding to a kubernetes pod are practically the same of
the original post. I've implemented a script to automate the creation of service account and kuneconfig file.

Difference from the original posts are in the deploy phase. While they suggest to perform port forwarding in the main action before doing any
operation, I prefer running it within a container service as suggested by the github team.

## Creating a service account with port forwarding permission

The main idea is to create a service account that can only perform port forwarding on the
target port. The GitHub action will the use this service account to run the port forward service.

Let suppose we want to open the port $PORT on the pod $POD in namespace $NAMESPACE.

Let's create the service account

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: $POD-forward
  namespace: $NAMESPACE
```

Then we need to create a custom role to with rules to port forwarding to the service account.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: $POD-forward
  namespace: $NAMESPACE
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    resourceNames: ["$POD"]
    verbs: ["get"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods/portforward"]
    resourceNames: ["$POD"]
    verbs: ["create"]
```

And finaly we can bind the role to the service account

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: $POD-forward
  namespace: $NAMESPACE
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: $POD-forward
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: $POD-forward
    namespace: $NAMESPACE
```

## Create a kubeconfing file to call kubernetes api as the service account

Now that we have a service account with the right permission, we need
to find a way to call api with the given service account.

So we need to create a kubeconfig file to connect to the kubernetes api using the
service account token.

We first need to get the token name using

```bash
$ TOKENNAME=`kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get serviceaccount/$POD-forward -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}'`
```

The token is stored on a kubernetes secret, to retrive it, we can use the following
command

```bash
$ TOKEN=`kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get secret/$TOKENNAME -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d`
```

We then need to extract the _Api server URL_ and _Cluster CA_ from the
the current kubernetes context. This can be done with the following commands.

```bash
$ SERVER=`kubectl config view --minify --output jsonpath="{.clusters[*].cluster.server}"`
$ CA=`kubectl config view --minify --flatten  --output jsonpath="{.clusters[*].cluster.certificate-authority-data}"`
```

And finally, we can create a kubeconfig file using the given token

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
  - cluster:
      server: $SERVER
      certificate-authority-data: $CA
    name: kubernetes
contexts:
  - context:
      cluster: kubernetes
      user: $POD-forward-sa
    name: target-cluster
current-context: target-cluster
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
  - name: $POD-forward-sa
    user:
      token: $TOKEN
```

Whis this kubeconfig file, we can now call the kubernetes api using the service account to port forward the given pod.

## Creating the container service

GitHub container service are really limitated, we cannot pass arguments to a container
neither run a container with a custom scripts. So we need to create a custom
container that is able to run `kubectl port-forward` and read kubeconfig from command line.
Moreover, we can only pass data to the service using env variables.

So I've prepared a custom Dockerfile starting from `bitnami/kubectl`. This container
copies the `$KUBECONFIG` base64 encoded data to a file and then runs `kubectl port-forward`
on `$POD` and `$NAMESPACE` also taken from env variables.

Here is the Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/kubectl
COPY ./entrypoint /entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint"]
```

And the Entrypoint

```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo $KUBECONFIG | base64 -d > $HOME/.kube/config
export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/config
kubectl port-forward -n $NAMESPACE $POD $PORTS --address='0.0.0.0'
```

I've prepared a [github repo](https://github.com/ludusrusso/kubectl-with-env-config)
that created and build this container.

The container is public avalable on the github containre registry `ghcr.io/ludusrusso/kubectl-with-env-config`.

The repo also [contains a script](https://github.com/ludusrusso/kubectl-with-env-config/blob/main/get-config.bash) to generate the encoded kubeconfig file following
the steps described in this post.

## Running the service

Now we have all the pieces to run the portforward service in our github action.

We need to configure the pod, namespace and base64 kuneconfig file as github action secrets and finally
we can open a port forward to the pod while running the action, here is an example.

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-push-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # run your actions
    services:
      db:
        image: ghcr.io/ludusrusso/kubectl-with-env-config:958062ab64ccfa815aa2f931c03f72a2a670232a
        env:
          KUBECONFIG: "${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}"
          NAMESPACE: "${{ secrets.NAMESPACE }}"
          POD: "${{ secrets.POD }}"
          PORTS: 5432:5432 # this is kubeconfig port parameter
        ports:
          - 5432:5432 # this is github service port parameter
```

You can find a real work example [here](https://github.com/farmaceutica-younger/www.farmaceuticayounger.science/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml). In this case
I open the port on a postgres database running on a kubernetes cluster to allow a nextjs build
to query the database at compile time.
